#' @title estimate death registration coverage for a single year/sex/region using the GGB method
#' 
#' @description Given two censuses and an average annual number of deaths in each age class between censuses, we can use stable population assumptions to estimate the degree of underregistration of deaths. The method is based on finding a best-fitting linear relationship between two modeled parameters (right term and left term), but the fit, and resulting coverage estimate, depend on exactly which age range is taken. This function either finds a nice age range for you automatically, or you can specify an exact vector of ages. Called by \code{ggb()}. Users probably don't need to call this directly. Just use \code{ggb()} instead.
#' 
#' Census dates can be given in a variety of ways: 1) using Date classes, and column names \code{$date1} and \code{$date2} (or an unambiguous character string of the date, like, \code{"1981-05-13"}) or 2) by giving column names \code{"day1","month1","year1","day2","month2","year2"} containing integers. If only \code{year1} and \code{year2} are given, then we assume January 1 dates. If year and month are given, then we assume dates on the first of the month. 
#' 
#' @param codi \code{data.frame} with columns, \code{$pop1}, \code{$pop2}, \code{$deaths}, \code{$date1}, \code{$date2}, and \code{$age}.
#' @param exact.ages optional. use an exact set of ages to estimate coverage.
#' @param minA the minimum of the age range searched. Default 15
#' @param maxA the maximum of the age range searched. Default 75
#' @param minAges the minimum number of adjacent ages needed as points for fitting. Default 8
#' @param deaths.summed logical. is the deaths column given as the total per age in the intercensal period (\code{TRUE}). By default we assume \code{FALSE}, i.e. that the average annual was given.

If only \code{year1} and \code{year2} are given, then we assume January 1 dates. If year and month are given, then we assume dates on the first of the month. If you want coverage estimates for a variety of intercensal periods/regions/by sex, then stack them, and use a variable called \code{$cod} with unique values for each data chunk. Different values of \code{$cod} could indicate sexes, regions, intercensal periods, etc. The \code{$deaths} column should refer to the average annual deaths for each age class in the intercensal period. Sometimes one uses the arithmetic average of recorded deaths in each age, or simply the average of the deaths around the time of census 1 and census 2. To identify an age-range in the traditional visual way, see \code{ggbChooseAges()}, when working with a single year/sex/region of data. The automatic age-range determination feature of this function tries to implement an intuitive way of picking ages that follows the advice typically given for doing so visually. We minimize the square of the average squared residual between the fitted line and right term.

#' @title interactively determine ages to use for estimating coverage
#' @description In a spreadsheet one would typically set up the GGB method to produce a plot that updates as the user changes the age range. This function implements that kind of work flow. This will be intuitive for spreadsheet users, but it does not scale well. Imagine you have 200 territorial units, then you would not want to repeat this task. \code{ggb()} does the same thing automatically. You can compare the age range you select manually with the one given back by \code{ggb()} as a diagnostic, for instance. To set up the plot device, just give a single year/region/sex of data. By default it will give the RMSE-optimized age range to start with, but you can specify a  vector of exact ages to use as well. All points are plotted, with a fitted line that has been set to a subset of the points, which is plotted in a different color. You can click any point to change the age range, and the plot updates accordingly, up to a maximum of 15 clicks so you don't waste your time. You can stop the plot by either clicking on the graphics device outside the plot area or clicking out the 15 tries (or more if you increase \code{maxit}).
#' @details If you want to send the results of this into \code{ggb()}, you can do so by setting \code{Exact.ages} to \code{seq(lower,upper,by=5)}, where \code{$lower}, and \code{$upper} are the results returned from \code{ggbChooseAges()} after you're done manually determining the age range.

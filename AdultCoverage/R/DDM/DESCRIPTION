Description: A set of three two-census methods to the estimate the degree of death registration coverage for a population. Implemented methods include the Generalized Growth Balance method (GGB), the Synthetic Extinct Generation method (SEG), and a hybrid of the two, GGB-SEG. Each method offers automatic estimation, but users may also specify exact parameters or use a graphical interface to guess parameters in the traditional way if desired.

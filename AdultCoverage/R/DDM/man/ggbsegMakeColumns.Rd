\usage{
ggbsegMakeColumns(
  codi,
  minA = 15,
  maxA = 75,
  agesFit.ggb,
  eOpen = NULL,
  deaths.summed = FALSE,

}
\arguments{
\item{codi}{a chunk of data (single sex, year, region, etc) with all columns required by \code{ggbseg()}}

\item{minA}{the lowest age to be included in search}

\item{maxA}{the highest age to be included in search (the lower bound thereof)}

\item{agesFit.ggb}{vector of ages for calculating coverage in the GGB method.}

\item{eOpen}{optional. A user-specified value for remaining life-expectancy in the open age group.}

\item{deaths.summed}{logical. Is the deaths column given as the total per age in the intercensal period (\code{TRUE}). By default we assume \code{FALSE}, i.e. that the average annual was given.}

\item{mig.summed}{logical. Is the (optional) net migration column \code{mig} given as the total per age in the intercensal period (\code{TRUE}). By default we assume \code{FALSE}, i.e. that the average annual was given.}

\item{lm.method}{character, one of:\itemize{
\item{\code{"oldschool"}} default sd ratio operation of still unknown origin
\item{\code{"lm"} or \code{"ols"}} for a simple linear model
\item{\code{"tls"}, \code{"orthogonal"}, or \code{"deming"}} for total least squares
\item{\code{"tukey"}, \code{"resistant"}, or "\code{"median"}} for Tukey's resistant line method
}}

\item{nx.method}{integer. either 2 or 4. 4 is smoother.}
}
\value{
codi, with many columns added, most importantly \code{$Cx}.
}
\description{
Called by \code{ggbsegCoverageFromYear()}. This simply modulates some code that would otherwise be repeated. Users probably don't need to call this function directly.
}
\details{
\code{agesFit} is a vector passed in from \code{ggbsegMakeColumns()}, and it was either estimated using the GGB automatic method there, or simply came from the argument \code{exact.ages} specified in \code{ggbseg()}. By default we just automatically estimate these. \code{eOpen} can be either user-specified, or it will be estimated automatically using \code{eOpenCD()}.
